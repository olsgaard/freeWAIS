freeWAIS is a text retrieval system based on the vector space model. freeWAIS-sf is an extension of freeWAIS, developed at the computer science department of the University of Dortmund. sf means structured fields and indicates the main improvement of freeWAIS-sf. The extensions include:

* improved document modeling: support for the logical structure of documents: a document is represented as a set of fields
* introduction of different index types, e. g. soundex and phonix for personal names or stemming for titles
* support for Boolean operators in queries
* search for numeric values with special predicates like less than and greater than.
* 8 bit clean

**Note:** All official mirrors of binaries and source-code are no longer around. This is a mirror taken from http://ftp.task.gda.pl/site/wais/, that state that users should not expect this mirror to stay online. This is why I moved the project on to github.

freeWAIS-sf is freely distributed under a public domain license, and can be modified freely by all. The *regular expressions* library is however released under a "nearly-public-domain"-license. See the regex library for details.
