enhancements and other user interfaces to be included in future releases.
If you are interested in doing this, please contact us so we do not
duplicate effort.

waissearch: A simple shell command for posing question.  see
../doc/waissearch.txt for details.

waisq: A shell level utility for using WAIS questions.  Used by the the gnu
emacs interface in wais.el.  See the ../doc/waisq.txt file for details.

wais.el is a gnu emacs interface.  See ../doc/wais.el.txt for details.

One thing to note for the Emacs interface on the NeXT: In wais.el lines
117-121:

    (let (
	  ;; this doesn't work on the NeXT.  Comment out this line.
	  (process-connection-type nil)
	  )

Be sure to comment out the local variable on the NeXT.

lucid.lisp is not finished yet, but will be a set of calling routines to
the wais client libraries (not a full user interface).
