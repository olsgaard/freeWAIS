In freeWAIS-sf-2.0.55, queries of the form

        word1 prox_op (word2 bool_op word3)

where prox_op is "w/n" or "pre/n" and bool_op is "and" or "or", do not work
properly.  I do not know much about the history of freeWAIS-sf, so I cannot
tell how many previous versions have the same problem.  However, a quick
check of the code I have indicates that the problem existed in
freeWAIS-sf-1.2-pre9 as well.

The problem is that the "and" and "or" operators simply concatenate the word
positions of their two operands.  However, the proximity operator assumes
that the word positions are in increasing order.  The following patch
changes the "and" and "or" operators to merge the word positions of their
operands in a way that preserves the increasing order of the word positions.

	New flex.

        Changed return type of read_weight_from*() to double. Some
	compilers like that more than float :-(.

	Init response now tells about the freeWAIS-sf Version.  There
	is currently no other way to determine what server you are
	connected to!

waisq.c	From: malyshki@cs.wmich.edu (Vladislav Malyshkin)

	The differencs between these files is :
        	1) added +1 to s_malloc(..) and s_realloc(...)
        	2) now waisq understands  new values for -v 
        	   option. Now it is possible to use 
	           -v 10-20    (print documents # 10,11,12,.....20)
                	and

	Did not add the program for filling the dbm database yet.

        Patch from Rodney Barnett:

I recently ported freeWAIS-sf-2.0.52 to DYNIX/ptx 4.10 running on a
Sequent S2000/250.  Along the way, I found a bug and had to make a few
changes to get it to compile.  The following describes the changes and
provides a patch.

1. problem: use of proximity operators causes core dump.
       fix: prox_value is no longer a char *, so don't s_free() it.
   file(s): query_l.l, query_l.c

2. problem: waisserver.c fails to compile because the O_* constants are
            not defined.
       fix: I_SYS_FILE is defined if sys/file.h defines the *_OK constants
            and shouldn't be used to determine what file to include for
            the O_* constants, so eliminate that #ifdef and allow the test
            of I_FCNTL to determine what to include for the O_* constants.
            Also, cdialect.h defines these variables and should be included
            before this test.  (NOTE: I'm not sure how this works for
            other UNIX variants, so take this fix with a grain of salt.)
   file(s): waisserver.c

3. problem: irsearch.c and sersrch.c fail to compile with an error about
            mismatched parameters for search_word_before_pairs () and
            search_word () respectively.
       fix: in the old-style (K&R) function definitions of these functions
            the compiler wides the float parameter (query_weight) to a
            double; however, that isn't required of the new-style function
            declaration, so the problem is really that the function
            prototype says that query_weight is a float, but the function
            definition says that query_weight is a double.  Fix that by
            making query_weight a double in the prototype.
   file(s): irsearch.c, sersrch.c, and irext.h

	Did I really forgot to integrate 2.0.1.[1-3] in the patches?
        Shudder. Prepare to save ir/query_y.c before running make
        unless you have bison. ir/query_y.c was up to date. It's
        source ir/query_y.y was not. So this patch updates
        ir/query_y.y and it will be newer than ir/query_y.c after
        applying the patch!

	Fixed erroneous beginning of line matches for headlines.

	Fix for literal searches from Ellen G. White.

	compiler unhappy.

	Removed prototype for search_word_before_pairs since it makes

	mystrcasecmp.

doc:
	Included new test.fmt. Change some of the off-by-one regexps
