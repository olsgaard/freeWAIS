freeWAIS Documentation

The majority of freeWAIS documents will be made available by WAIS, WWW,
and Gopher.  Try the CNIDR WWW server (http://cnidr.org/welcome.html) for
the latest documents.  Now that we have some moderately stable (although
certainly not bug-free) code, we will be spending a bit of time on
installation documents, etc.

Your comments are welcome.  Please send them to freewais@cnidr.org.
