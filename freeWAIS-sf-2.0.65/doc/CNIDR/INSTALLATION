_______________________________________________________________________

This package has been written for ANSI-C.  GNU CC and non-ANSI cc's are
supported by adding a bunch of library routines that were not present.
It has been run on a VAX, Sun-3, Sun-4, SGI and NeXT, System V, gcc, cc,
ThinkC.  Pieces have been run on VMS.  We are interested in promoting
the portability of this code.  If you run into problems, please help by
reporting (or fixing) bugs to freeWAIS@cnidr.org.

These are some instructions on installation and building of the software
in this distribution.

To use the software in this release, you must first uncompress and untar
the distribution file.

This will create a directory called freeWAIS-0.2, with a number of
subdirectories.

To build the software, first modify the file freeWAIS-0.2/Makefile
according to the comments to conform to your particular
Hardware/Software architecture.  You will have to set the variable
"TOP", as this is not done automatically. Be sure to comment out the
lines that say "comment-me".  Then simply type "make".

(You might also have to modify config.h in the top-level directory, but
only if you have an unusual architecture).

Most of the software will be made automatically, but the X windows user
interface may not be made due to your particular system's installation
of the X windows based software.  This release includes an Imakefile,
which can be used to create a Makefile that includes the locations of
the X software for a particular site.  If you can build an X
application, you should be able to build xwais.

One thing to note for the Emacs interface on the NeXT: In ui/wais.el
lines 126-130:

    (let (
          ;; this doesn't work on the NeXT.  Comment out this line.
          (process-connection-type nil)
          )

Be sure to comment out the local variable on the NeXT.

More information on this release can be found in the README file in this
directory.
