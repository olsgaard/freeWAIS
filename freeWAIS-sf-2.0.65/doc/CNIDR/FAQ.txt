What is WAIS?

 WAIS stands for Wide Area Information Servers, and is an architecture for
 a distributed information retrieval system.  WAIS is based on the client
 server model of computation, and allows users of computers to share
 information using a common computer-to-computer protocol.  WAIS was
 originally designed and implemented by a development team at Thinking
 Machines, Inc. led by Brewster Kahle.  Kahle has formed WAIS Inc. to
 provide commercial WAIS software and services, and the support for the
 freely available version (freeWAIS) has been assumed by the
 Clearinghouse for Networked Information Discovery and Retrieval (CNIDR).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where can I get.......

 WAIS is available via anonymous FTP from a variety of sources.  The
 distributor of the original WAIS is think.com, in the wais subdirectory.
 freeWAIS is distributed from ftp.cnidr.org.

 a. a mac client?


  two Macintosh clients are provided in freeWAIS.
                                or
  think.com:/wais/WAIStation0.62.hqx

 b. a unix client?

  a few UNIX based clients are available in the core freeWAIS  distribution,
  which can be found on ftp.cnidr.org.  These include X (Motif and
  Athena),  a simple screen-oriented client (SWAIS) a command-line client
  (waissearch) and the components for an emacs-compliant client.


 c. a dos client?

  MS-DOS and MS-Windows clients are available in the freeWAIS
  distribution.  The MS-DOS clients are based on Waterloo TCP and packet
  drivers, while the MS-Windows clients are based on Winsock.

 d. a NeXT client?

   A NeXTStep client is available in the freeWAIS distribution.

 e. a VMS client?

  WAIS has been ported to VMS by the folks at the University of North
  Carolina.  freeWAIS has not yet been ported to VMS (any volunteers?)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do I locate WAIS databases??

 WAIS provides a service called the Directory of Servers.  The Directory of
 Servers is a WAIS server like any other information source, but contains
 information about the other WAIS servers on the Internet.  To find out
 about servers, simply ask the directory-of-servers source a question.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
What do I do when the directory of servers is unreachable?

 Sometimes the Directory of Servers is not available.  There are backup
 servers that contain copies of the list of sources in the Directory of
 Servers.  To find out about them, use the Directory of Servers when it is
 available, and ask about "directory of servers".  There are at least two
 directories of servers in the United States, with several others around
 the world.  The US servers are:

        directory-of-servers:quake.think.com
        directory-of-servers:cnidr.org

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do I add a server to the directory of servers?

 To add a server to the Directory of Servers, simply mail a source
 description structure to wais-directory-of-servers@cnidr.org or
 wais-directory-of-servers@quake.think.com.

 If you use the waisindex program from the core freeWAIS distribution, you may
 use the -register argument and the source description structure will be
 mailed automatically to both national servers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where can I read more about WAIS in the trade press?


 A complete WAIS bibliography will be available on ftp.cnidr.org.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Z39.50?

 Z39.50 is a computer-to-computer protocol designed for information
 search and retrieval.  The newest releases of freeWAIS (those with a
 release of 1.0 or higher) support Z39.50-92 as well as original WAIS
 queries.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who is working on Z39.50 implementations?

Below is a definitely incomplete list, and these are people working on
servers and/or clients). "Working on" is a rough phrasing for some:

    Apple
    AT&T Library Network
    BRS Software
    CARL Systems
    CNIDR
    Columbia Law School
    DRA   (Data Research Associates)
    Dartmouth College
    FCLA
    Gaylord Information Systems
    Innovative Interfaces Inc.
    Library of Congress
    MDC   (Mead Data Central)
    MIT Information Services
    NOTIS
    OCLC
    Pandora Systems
    Penn State
    RLG
    Stanford University
    UC Berkeley
    UC DLA (Division of Library Automation)
    University of North Carolina
    Viginia Tech

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do they interoperate?

Yes.  Within the acceptable limits provided by the protocol, Z39.50-92
systems will interoperate.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where do these people talk about protocol details?

Lots of different places.  The ZIP list at CNIDR provides a discussion
forum for the freely available release of Z39.50-92, while the Z3950IW
list at the Florida Center for Library Automation provides a iscussion of
the technical details of Z39.50.

        zip@cnidr.org - send a subscribe message to zip-request@cnidr.org.  This

        list is maintained by a human, so any message will do.

        z3950iw@nervm.bitnet - send a standard subscribe message to
        z3950iw-request@nervm.bitnet

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
What's a Z39 anyway?  Where did these people come from?

Z39 is a committee - more commonly known as NISO.  Here is what they say
about themselves.

From: NISO brochure titled "Making the information profession more productive"
NISO ... develops and promotes consensus-approved standards used in
library services, publishing, and many other information-related
industries.

NISO standards address the communication needs of these industries
in areas such as information retrieval, preservation of materials,
information transfer, forms and records, identification systems,
publication formats, and equipment and supplies...

NISO was created more than a half-century ago as Committee
Z39 of the American National Standards Institute.  ANSI is the
organization that administers the U.S. system of voluntary
standardization.

Since its inception, NISO has developed more than 50 technical
standards...

NISO's current mission includes:
   .  Identifying areas in which standards are needed.
   .  Developing, writing, and maintaining voluntary technical standards.
   .  Reviewing and improving existing standards.
   .  Representing U.S. Interests in international standards development.
   .  Coordinating NISO standards with other national and
      international standards developers..."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
What other systems work with WAIS?

 WAIS is principally a protocol, and hence other systems designed for
 information access may use the protocol through gateways.  WAIS is based
 on Z39.50-88, while freeWAIS (v. 1.0 and greater)  is based on Z39.50-92,
 with a backwards compatibility module for the original WAIS.

 What's the difference?

   (Note: ISO is the International Standards Organization. There is a standard
   ISO 10162/10163, the Search and Retrieval (SR) Service Definition and
   Protocol Definition. Its importance/relevance given below)

There are two categories of changes from the 1988 version to the 1992
version (version 2): changes necessary for alignment with SR, and
features deemed necessary by implementors, to provide sufficient
functionality so that implementation can be economically justified.

In the first category: The 1988 version was developed between 1983-87
(and approved by ANSI in 1988).  Meanwhile, development of the ISO
Search and Retrieve protocol took a parallel and somewhat complimentary
path: There were various drafts of SR between 1984 and 1991 (when it was
finally approved);  the U.S. input to SR was influenced by Z39.50, but
Z39.50 wasn't entirely stable during that period.  The result was that
a few incompatibilities remained. For example, the search request in SR
has small-set- and medium-set-element-set-names; Z39.50 version 1 had
only a single, or global, element set parameter.  As another example,
version 1 did not include Preferred-record-syntax.  Version 1 did not
use ASN.1.  (Virtually all OSI application protocol data structures are
described using ASN.1.  Version 1 was finalized slightly before ASN.1
was stable, and version 1 developed a homegrown syntax notation which
has been abandoned in version 2.)  A serious limitation of version 1 is
the lack of flexibility to reference objects -- attribute-sets,
diagnostic-sets, and other objects -- which SR references through OSI
object identifiers.  All of these limitations are corrected in Z39.50
version 2.

In the second category are enhancements to security, access control, and
attribute sets and related objects; and a new "proximity" query.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
What's the scoring algorithm used by WAIS?

freeWAIS scores documents based on the number of occurances of the query
words in a document, the location of the words in ta document, the
frequency of those words within the collection, and the size of the document.

Original WAIS scored based on the word position and word count in each
document (5 points if the word occurred in the headline, 1 point
otherwise).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do I approximate a boolean search?

freeWAIS supports simple boolean searching.  The words and, or, and not
are interpreted to mean a request for a boolean search with the boolean
operaton being performed on the terms delimited by the operators.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do I make a good index to a set of documents?

The most important thing is to make sure your documents quantify well.
Remember, putting everything into one large document will result in one
large document being returned for each search!  Try to come up with an
indexing scheme that will allow the user to see a clear headline for each
quantum of information that might be useful.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
What alternatives do I have to the default document parser?

The default parser in freeWAIS supports many datatypes, and can easily be
modified to support others.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are there any commercial WAIS servers?

Yes.  For more information about commercial WAIS servers, contact WAIS,
Inc. (frontdesk@wais.com).  This is the only commercial WAIS providor at
this time.  Many companies market Z39.50 systems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Can I use WAIS to search through and display
  images?
  sounds?
  video?
  X-rays?
  Postscript files?
  SGML-encoded text?
  multimedia documents?
  e-mail?
  usenet news?
  catalogs, directories, lists, lexicons, dictionaries?

  In a word, yes.  WAIS is not limited to text documents.  Other data
  types can be searched by using different search engines and parsers.
  It is still rather difficult to change search engines, but future
  releases of freeWAIS will provide a much better mechanism for this.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do I do WAIS over a dialup connection ?

You can't, yet.  You *can* access WAIS clients via a dialup connection.
Many sites provide access to simple WAIS - a screen-oriented WAIS client.
