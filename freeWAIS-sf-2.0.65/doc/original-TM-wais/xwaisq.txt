     NAME
          xwaisq - X interface to the WAIS questions

     SYNOPSIS
          xwaisq [ standard X toolkit arguments ] [ QuestionName ]

     DESCRIPTION

          xwaisq is an X Windows based client for the WAIS system.  It is
          the application used for modifying and submitting questions to a
          WAIS server.

          This application is heavily dependant on the X Toolkit resource
          mechanism.  Questions are stored to the user's "questionDirec-
          tory" (usually ~/wais-questions) and can be retrieved using this
          application.

          A question is posed in three parts:

          1.  Search words, labeled "Tell me about"
          2.  Sources, labeled "In Sources"
          3.  Relevance Feedback, labeled "Similar to"

          Search words can be entered into the "Tell me about" frame by
          simply typing into the frame.  Pressing return will initiate the
          search (however, if you have not yet specified a source, you'll
          be warned, and no search will actually occur).

          To add a source  to  a question, press  "Add Source", and select
          the source from the popup  menu.  To remove  a source  from  the
          question,  select the source, and click on the "Delete Source"
          button.

          To add a document to a question, select the document in the
          Result Document list, and press "Add Document".   To remove  a
          document  from the question, select the document, and click on
          the "Delete Document" button.

          When  you have you question completely  defined, you can search
          the sources by pressing the "Search" button, or <RETURN> in the
          "Tell me about" window.

          To view  a resulting  document, select the  document and  press
          the "View" button.  A  new Document  window  will appear.    If
          you'd like to see  the keywords matched, press the "Find Key"
          button.   To save the document  to a file, press  the "Save to
          File"  button.  When  you are finished  with the document, press
          "Done" button in the Document window.

          When you are finished with the question close its window using
          the "Done" button.  Any changes to the question  will be written
          back to the question directory.

     FILES

          Xwais                         application Default file.
          $(HOME)/wais-questions        location of saved questions.
          $(HOME)/wais-sources          location for personal sources.

     RESOURCES

          The following resources may be changed to modify the default
          behavior of the application.  I recommend you look at the
          resource file Xwais to get a better idea of all the resources
          available.

          Xwais*questionDirectory:      ~/wais-questions/
          Xwais*documentDirectory:      ~/wais-documents/
          Xwais*userSourceDirectory:    ~/wais-sources/
          Xwais*commonSourceDirectory
          Xwais*seedWords
          Xwais*initialSource
          Xwais*questionName
          Xwais*DoSearch

          The last four resources are usually unspecified.  Under special
          circumstances they may be used to fully specify a question
          without a file.

     BUGS

          xwaisq is heavily dependant on it's resources.  If it is unable
          to find the proper resource file, it will most likey become unus-
          able.

          xwaisq has no limit to resizing, so if the window is resized too
          small, some buttons may be lost.
