     NAME
          waisq

     DESCRIPTION

          This is a shell level interface to WAIS questions that have been
          built using xwais.  It allows a user to submit questions to
          sources for queries, and to retrieve documents from questions
          (and the appropriate source).  It can build or modify a question,
          including the modification performed during a search.

     USAGE

          waisq
            [-f question_file] /* defaults to stdin, stdout */
            [-s sourcedir] /* or ~/wais-sources/ */
            [-S sourcename]
            [-c common_sourcedir] /* or it is ignored */
            [-m max_Result_Docs] /* defaults to 40 */
            [-v document_number]
            [-g] /* to do a search */
            [-h] /* this message */
            [-t] /* test a source */
            [-V] /* print version */
            [word [word [...]]]
          or

           waisq - [other options] /* for interactive mode */

     OPTIONS

          -f question_filename
                    the pathname for a question structure as stored in a
                    file.  It uses standard UNIX conventions.  If no
                    filename is provided, stdin is used.  If the filename
                    is a dash ( - ), no question will be read, so you must
                    specify a sourcename and the words to search.  This
                    will create a question structure and write it to
                    stdout.


          -s sourcedir
                    a directory where source structures are stored.  It
                    must end with a '/'.  If it is not specified, ~/wais-
                    sources/ is used.  If none of those exist, the applica-
                    tion will probably fail, unless the common_sourcedir
                    exists.  Only files that end in .src in the directory
                    are considered sources.

          -S sourcename
                    the pathname of a source structure file.  It must exist
                    in sourcedir or common_sourcedir, and end in .src

          -c common_sourcedir
                    Similar to sourcedir, but usually common for a site. It
                    need not exist.

          -m maxDocs
                    The limit on the number of results returned by a
                    server.  Default value is 40.

          -v document_number
                    The number of the document to retrieve from a valid
                    query.  This can be from a previously stored question,
                    or the current question if the -g option is used.

          -t        Test a source to see if it is servicing wais requests.
                    The first word will be taken as the name of a source.

          -g        Submit the query.  You must specify the -g option in
                    order to actually perform a query.  You need not
                    specify it if you have already performed a query from
                    which you wish to retrieve a document.

          -V        Print the version number and date of the program.

          word...   optional search keywords to replace any search keywords
                    in the question.

          -         If the first argument is a dash ( - ) then waisq
                    operates in an interactive mode.  It then reads ques-
                    tion structures from standard input, and returns
                    results to standard output.  If the question has
                    search-words or relevant documents, it performs the
                    query, and returns the resulting question structure to
                    standard output.  If there are only result documents,
                    it retrieves them and prints them to standard output.
                    It continues to read it's input until an end of file is
                    encountered, and then it exits.  All other command line
                    switches will work, except -f.  This makes waisq useful
                    as a tool for user interfaces to access the WAIS sys-
                    tem.

     EXAMPLES

          to create a new question and submit it for a query:
               waisq -f - -S sourcename -g word1 word2 > my_question

          to submit an existing question for query:
               waisq -f question_name -g

          To retrieve a response:
               waisq -f question_name -v 1
