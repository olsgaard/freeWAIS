     NAME
          waissearch - Simple shell user interface for making WAIS requests

     DESCRIPTION
          Part of the Wide Area Information Server system.

          waissearch makes a WAIS request over TCP/IP.


     OPTIONS

          -h host-machine
                    Server machine name as a IP name.  Defaults to local
                    machine.

          -p [ service-or-port ]
                    Use this port to communicate.  If it is not supplied,
                    then z39_50 is used from the services file.

          -m max-results
                    Set the maximum number of results returned for a query.
                    Default is 40.

          -d database
                    The database to use in the query.  By convention, many
                    servers support the INFO database.

          -v        Print the version number and date of this command.


     EXAMPLE

          to query the directory of servers about tcp servers:
               waissearch -h quake.think.com -d directory-of-servers \ -p
               210 tcp

          to ask what tcp databases are supported on a particular server:
               waissearch -h quake.think.com -d INFO -p 210 tcp

          to ask for information on a database:
               waissearch -h quake.think.com -d directory-of-servers \ -p
               210 help
