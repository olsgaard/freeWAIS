     NAME
          xwais - X interface to the WAIS system

     SYNOPSIS
          xwais [ standard X toolkit arguments ]

     DESCRIPTION

          xwais is a simple interface that allows the selection and modifi-
          cation of WAIS questions and sources.

          There are basically three kinds of windows you will see in Xwais:

          1. the main Xwais window.
          2. a number of Question windows.
          3. a Source window.

          In the main Xwais window you'll see two lists - Questions and
          Sources.

          To open a question, select the question in the Question List and
          press the "Open" button in the  Question frame.  To create a  new
          question, press the "New" button in  the  Question frame.   Press
          "Help" in  the resulting Question window    for  information  on
          how  to   manipulate questions.

          To add a new source, press the "New"  button in the  Source
          Frame.  To edit an old source,  press  the "Open"  button.

          To exit the application, click twice on the "Quit"  button.  This
          only closes the Xwais "shell".  Questions must be closed expli-
          citly.

          Remember, your window  manager may be managing  some of these
          windows, so if you  click on a  button and see  no window,  check
          to see if the window has actually been iconified.

     FILES
          Xwais                         application Default file.
          $(HOME)/wais-questions        location of saved questions.
          $(HOME)/wais-sources          location for personal sources.

     RESOURCES

          The following resources may be changed to modify the default
          behavior of the application.  I recommend you look at the
          resource file Xwais to get a better idea of all the resources
          available.
          Xwais*questionDirectory:      ~/wais-questions/
          Xwais*userSourceDirectory:    ~/wais-sources/
          Xwais*commonSourceDirectory:  /proj/wais/wais/wais-sources/

     BUGS

          xwais currently has a limit of twenty questions. It will arbi-
          trarily trunctate the list to the first twenty files it sees.

          xwais does not sort the question or source lists.  It really
          should.

          xwais is heavily dependant on it's resources.  If it is unable to
          find the proper resource file, it will most likey become unus-
          able.

          xwais has no limit to resizing, so if the window is resized too
          small, some buttons may be lost.
